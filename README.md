# Metagenomic-Data-Analysis-Retrieval-of-Metadata
In this repository, you will find code related to the retrieval of metadata for metagenomic data analysis. The code is focused on extracting relevant information from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) for the purpose of further analysis and interpretation of metagenomic data. The code utilizes the ENA's data view API to retrieve metadata for specific ENA accessions and writes the retrieved information to a file for subsequent use. The repository serves as a resource for researchers and scientists who are working with metagenomic data and looking for an efficient way to access and use the metadata from the ENA.
